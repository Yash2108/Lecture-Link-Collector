# Lecture-Link-Collector
Lecture-Link-Collector is a python program made for Nutons that takes a course name as input and collects all the google drive links of the recordings of that particular course and lets you save it in a csv file format or upload it to your google drive account as a spreadsheet. 

  It is aimed for Nutons who want an easy way to access the recordings of a particular course instead of using the learn portal calendar or for Nutons who want to copy and save all the google drive links of lecture recordings of a particular course for future use. 
This program will use selenium to do this cumbersome task for you.
Just run it in the console of your OS and it will guide you through.

  A sample of the output is also provided as [Sample_Optimization.csv](Sample_Optimization.csv).
  
Requirements for execution:
1. Python3
2. Selenium
3. chromedriver/geckodriver
  
  Precautions to be taken: 
1. Your password will be masked while you are entering it although it is recommended that you don't use any IDEs like IDLE since masking will not work there. It is better to use the console of your OS.
